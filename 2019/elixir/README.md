# AdventOfCode2019

Running problems individually:
```bash
mix run -e Aoc.Day01.run
```

I'll be working on using doctests for the general scenarios with `mix_test_watch`

```bash
mix test.watch
```
Then, make changes, and watch test runner automatically run doctests.

Or, to run once:
```bash
mix test
```
